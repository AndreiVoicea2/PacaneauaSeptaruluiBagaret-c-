## About The Project
It is a small project started from a simple curiosity to see the working mechanism of a gambling machine. A mechanism that seems very easy to implement initially, but which is complicated by mathematical logic, using both notions of matrices and elements from the theory of probabilities. All this demanding an efficient implementation both in terms of memory and execution time of the respective program. It is a challenge for a mathematician, computer scientist and probably passionate about gambling.
